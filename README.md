A fullstack music themed e-commerce web application that can handle users, artists, and admins throughout the process of song marketing, audience interaction, and multi-format music purchase.

All the functionality is protected and cannot be tampered with by end users through the api. 

This application uses CI/CD through Netlify for the front end and CI/CD through GitHub Actions, Docker, and Linode for the back end.
